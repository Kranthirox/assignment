      Taahis Redmi Note 11 starts at $180 for a 4/64GB unit (and this is if you
      missed the early bird deal) and goes up to $230 for a 6/128GB unit. That's
      a bit less than last year's vanilla Redmi Note 10, which is curious.
      Perhaps the reason for that is that not all of the changes are strictly
      upgrades over the last year's model. The Snapdragon 680 4G chipset for
      this year is definitely newer than the Snapdragon 678 in the Redmi Note 10
      and is hence made on a much smaller and more efficient 6nm manufacturing
      process (compared to 11nm).

      Even though it's a newer chipset, the Adreno 610 GPU inside the Snapdragon 680 is a downgrade compared to the Adreno 612 inside last year's Snapdragon 678. The same goes for the camera DSP, which is limited to 1080p video capture. Yet another unfortunate case of a 2022 device dropping 4K recording due to the feature being dropped from the Snapdragon 680 and Snapdragon 695.
